# On The Rocks 

I have created a cocktail recipe site to display my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. My website allows users to interact with the page,
they are able to Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes that they have added to the site. 

# UX

As a cocktail lover, there are always new recipes to explore. This site allows users to search for a recipe they 
would love to try, get inspiration by searching their favourite spirit in the search bar and see what new cocktails
they can create with what they have in the house!

- to view user created cocktails
- to read the ingredients needed for each recipe
- to read the method used to make each recipe
- to see which user created this recipe
- to register an account
- to log in as an existing user
- to log out of their account
- to view their profile page including a list of recipes they have added (if any)
- to allow users to edit or delete recipes they have added
- to contact us to make a reservation
- to find the location of the bar with the google maps to visit us
